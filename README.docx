CLOUD BASED SMART PARKING SYSTEM AND DRIVER RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM FOR PARKING USING ARDUINO


1.	INTRODUCTION
	With the growing populations in the era of mechanical life, the need for vehicles whether it may be two, three or four- wheelers according to one’s comfort and for easy management to meet daily requirement are also growing. Yearly there was the tremendous growth in the buying of new vehicles. With the growth of vehicles there rises the problem like traffic congestion, vehicle parking issues, long waiting time in traffic and in searching a slot for parking as unaware of the location of the parking place, accidents, parking at roadside, extra travel time are there.
 
Figure 1 picture by Sentinel Digital Desk (29 Jan 2020 10:06 AM) which shows irregular management of traffic and parked vehicles at large number on the roadside makes difficult to tackle the situation.	 
	As per the article (Desk, 2020) Sentinelassam published this year, presents the latest report by “TomTom traffic Index” which analysis the traffic conditions across the world and states that of the cities of India having the world worst traffic condition, in which Bangalore tops the list despite of continuous efforts taken by the traffic management of the city. The clogging of road due to roadside parking (Jul 20, 2019 and Ist, n.d.) as the driver of the vehicle is unaware of the location and availability of the nearest slot for parking makes driver to park at the roadside and bears fine for parking at non parking zones. So, there lies the supply demand gap between the users and parking zones providers and if this gap is fulfilled then this will be benefited to everyone and reduces the above-mentioned problems. 
The key challenging task for the driver to detect the nearest parking slot. As per the survey report done for heavily traffic congested cities the among various cities of the world, it takes more than 50% of the time to locate palace to park which end up in wastage of time and fuel. This problem can be resolved by pre- reserving or knowing the availability of the nearest parking slots with respect to the driver. So, there occurs the need for the driver’s parking recommendation system as per the vehicle. This proposed parking system is not restricted to city or the places with bottleneck traffic conditions but if it is implemented to all over the country as like the google maps to avoid future traffic and parking issues and comfort to driver from the hectic traffic, safety of vehicle, proper utilization of time and money.

1.1.	THE SCOPE OF THE CLOUD BASED SMART PARKING SYSTEM

In this smart parking system, the driver can pre-book the parking slot and can know the availability of the nearest parking slot with price and direction. The implementation of high price at the congested area due to low availability of the parking slots and due to traffic. The cloud-based data management is used for the faster and secured data transmission and the load management among the servers. It provides the reliable communication between the user and parking management system with the real time data for accurate knowledge of the information to driver with all updates by continuously monitoring the database of local server with the central repository. This paper represents the model scheme method for the pre detection and smart parking management system especially in urban areas or the areas where there a need for the parking and traffic related issues.
This project report is on the implementing the a well organized parking system where a driver can know the location of the allocated parking area with all the details such as free  or paid parking with showing  the facilities which were a driver can be use that provided by the management of the parking area. this paper proposes a concept of driver recommendation system for parking their vehicle by the easy slot detection inside a parking area and interfacing the driver and different parking management system through web and android based application that can be easily accessible through internet of things (IoT) by using wireless sensor networks (WSN).

1.2.	SOME EXISTING SMART PARKING SYSTEMS	
There are many countries like India, Dubai, UK, USA, Germany, Japan, China etc. are working on the development of smart parking system as in the part of smart cities to meet the need of the people and reduce the management issues related to traffic, parking, accident and many other related problems which is explained in this report can be solved by fully developed smart parking 
system. Here are some of the existing parking system with its detail description of features and the extent of approach which is relevant to this report work.
In India a group of people Rasika Pansare, Chirag Jain, Rahul Gupta have successfully implemented a IoT based mobile- based parking management system (Tyagi, 2018)through the app named as Get My Parking in city Delhi where driver gets the real time updates parking vacancies in the city with the location and type of payment by providing the required communication between the management of parking and driver of the vehicle and they had digitized over 300 parking slots. This is further need to develop by add booking of parking slot and instantaneous change in price in certain over- crowded and traffic congested areas. In this implemented technology they further need to develop the solution related to the manpower management in the parking areas as the by introducing the automated identification of the slot in parking area as well as in the application through which the driver is connected through internet. 
RTA Dubai launches  (Verdict Traffic, 2017) “Smart Parking Project” at Al -Rigga and at the WTC by installing sensors which detects the vehicle and updates the information so that the users can provided with real time information of the vacancies of the parking slots at different areas with the duration of the parking and parked vehicles. This is confined to very small area and can be upgraded by using further smart sensors with the applied one such as smart cameras, distance tracking sensors, and also the updating the facility of different vehicle other than cars.
The report deals with the build and development of a parking management system for assisting the driver to park their vehicles smartly without much effort majorly focusing of the concept of assisting the remote driver about the location of the parking area with the availability of slots, type of parked spaces like free or paid parking, pre- booking facility and directions to the nearby or selected location of the parking area.

2.	RELATED RESEARCH WORKS 

Many previous research works has been developed for smart parking systems based on using various approaches of IoT technologies such radio frequency identification RFID, ultra-high frequency (UHF), wireless sensor network WSN which provides the better data transmission and object detection and tracking but these systems are confined to smaller area as of its range. Few sensors which are used to detect and manage the automatic operations through the controller board such as light detecting and motion detecting sensor, proximity sensors, IR sensors, ultrasonic sensors in the individual parking system. These systems are confined to the internal management of the parking slots but when the driver can’t able to locate the parking area, but driver can know the availability of the parking slot before entry into the area by the LCD. Some of the following previous works which has been taken into consideration for this project work are briefly described.

•	A Case Study: Growing Parking Issues and Effective Parking Management Strategies: in this report author (ResearchGate, n.d.) has highlighted the concept of implementing the emerging need of well-organized way of allocating the parking areas rather than confining the users for the usage of the private vehicles. In this report the author (ResearchGate, n.d.) discussed about the resolving the issues related to the parking of the vehicles by growing demands of the vehicles by zonal distribution of the parking lots in the city based on the same factors like level of congestion, demand of parking, crowded area. This report also describes the benefits regarding the implementation of the parking management system to the users, society and environment while representing the report work done on the case study of different country and cities in India as per the increasing utilization of buying and using the vehicles and also stated the issues related to the vehicles parking which provides some details which is useful in the developing the initial stage of the project. 
As this report only presents the consequences of the implementation of the efficient parking management system in the city which considered as the approach method for the need of proposed system to the benefits of the society but not the working mechanisms of fully developed of the automated parking system.

•	A Wireless Sensor Node Based Efficient Parking Slot Availability Detection System for Smart Cities: the author ¬ (U. et al., 2018) in this report has proposed the concept of developing a real time information for the availability of the parking slot in a area by using a mobile application to the user in a nearby parking system which utilizes the wireless sensor node  which detects the vehicle activity and updates the information to the local server of that parking area and this information is updated into the database of the cloud server dynamically and provides the feature to 

the driver of the vehicle to reserve the parking slot in selected parking provider. The above-mentioned concept is demonstrated by developing a prototype and configuring a three layer of communications which are Sensor node layer: Here ultrasonic sensor is used to detect the vehicle and when the vehicle is detected in the parking slot the related information is processed wirelessly by using wireless module.	     Server Interface Layer: The Java server with the database for the communication used for the development of the android app functionality access the information required for utilisation of parking slots.   Application layer:	the drive with the use of the android application can manage the booking availability at the selected parking. 
The proposed architecture below explains the working of the procedure of the authors (U. et al., 2018) proposed parking system which the status of the slots.

 
Figure 2 Proposed architecture of cloud-based parking slot detection

•	IoT based sensor enabled smart car parking for advanced driver assistance system: the author (Mahendra et al., 2017) in his report develops a prototype to the parking assistance system to the driver where driver gets updated with the availability of the parking slot from mobile based application remotely with the approach to IoT’s. here for the identification of slots is identified by placing the IR sensor at each and every parking slots and when the vehicle is detected then in updates the value of slots to the database of the server which is monitored continuously by the cloud server and updated the information and sends to the requested driver and about the parking area and slots and also provides the facility of reserving of slot up to a period of time.

 
Figure 3 flow chart of mobile based application
The workflow process is explained through this flowchart all the above-mentioned project work but here need more to explain about full city management of parking areas and this report is confined to a smaller and one parking area. The author explains his report with the integration of all the sensor components which is controlled by embedded board and updates the information to the drives as per the selected option in the mobile based parking application. Here author (Mahendra et al., 2017) just explains the working prototype with three slots but it would be worthy enough if explains the in-city parking management.

3.	METHODOLOGY

There are two phases considered for the development of the project to establishment the connection between the drivers and all the parking management system servers with maintaining the all activity of data at each end points by maintaining the database. There are two level of database management required to provides the information related to vehicle activity related to the accessing the slot to park and monitoring all the slots with continuous integration and updating the fields. So, the two levels where the data are maintained is one the database at local sever level where there relies the information to the number of vacant, occupied, booked slots and detail log of information of each vehicle which accessed the services by that parking area. The second level  database at the cloud server which can also considered as central repository where it continuously monitors all the parking slots at each parking area and continuously updates its field whenever the changes occurs to provide the real- time information to the driver about the status of the nearby slots of the parking stations to access the reliable services by selecting one of the parking providers by sending the request to cloud server CS and CS updates the driver desired services to that selected parking provider by the driver in the city by updating the information to the local server of that parking management system to make changes accordingly the request made by the driver and sends the confirmation of the request by driver
